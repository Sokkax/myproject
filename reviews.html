          <p>The Pt's at TNT GYM knows how to achieve results and how to motivate you to achieve them. Got a custom workout plan and went from there. Results week on week.<br>Support and motivation all along the way. Highly recommend

          <p>i joined Tnt when i was 17 years old. I heard lots about the gym through friends and just seeing them on social media sites.<br>i found it scary at first but after a week i was never not in the gym in my free time

          <p>when i joined TNT i was mainly there for just trying to lose weight and get fit but then was told about thier yoga classes and i was secptical about it first due to me never doing it before but 10 minutes in i fell in love with it and havent missed a yoga class since!.</p>
